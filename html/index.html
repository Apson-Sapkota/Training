                    <h3>Welcome To Our Site</h3>
                    <p>I am Ben Carling, the owner and head coach at Sports Performance Services Ltd, based in Douglas,
                        Isle of Man. After studying business management, I decided embark in a career that was also a
                        passion of mine; health and fitness. I had played sports from an early age so it seemed a
                        natural thing to do. I became a qualified Personal Trainer, and latterly an accredited Strength
                        and Conditioning coach with the UKSCA. Currently there are only 4 accredited coaches in the Isle
                        of Man, and circa 600 in the UK.
                        <br>As well as private work, I work at the Isle of Man Sport Institute. I work with a wide cross
                        section of athletes from different sports, from field based sports such as football, rugby and
                        hockey to individual sports such as archery, sailing, tennis, motorsport and swimming. I am
                        proud to have played my part in helping these athletes set personal bests, Island records and
                        some that have gone on to achieve scholarships or youth contracts at professional level.
